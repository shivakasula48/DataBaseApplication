## Key Features

### Database Connectivity
- Establishes a secure connection with MySQL using JDBC.
- Configurable database credentials for flexibility.

### User-Friendly Interface
- A well-designed homepage built using Java Swing (JFrame).
- Navigation buttons for user interactions:
  - **View Profile**: Fetches and displays user details from the database.
  - **Settings**: Placeholder for future settings functionality.
  - **Logout**: Closes the application.

### Data Management
- Retrieves user data from the `users` table in the database.
- Displays user information through a pop-up dialog.

---


## Technologies Used

- **Java**: Programming language for application logic.
- **MySQL**: Database management system for storing user information.
- **JDBC**: API for connecting the application to the MySQL database.
- **NetBeans IDE**: Development environment.
- **XAMPP**: Tool for running MySQL locally.

## Setup Instructions

### 1. Clone the Repository
- Open your terminal or command prompt.
- Run the following commands to clone the repository and navigate into the project directory:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/shivakasula48/DataBaseApplication.git

```
```
cd DataBaseApplication
```


### 2. Install Prerequisites

Ensure the following software is installed on your system:

- **Java Development Kit (JDK)**: Version 8 or later.
- **NetBeans IDE**: Recommended for developing and running the project.
- **XAMPP**: For running the MySQL server locally.
- **MySQL Connector/J**: Ensure the JDBC driver `.jar` file is added to the project.


### 3. Configure the Database

#### Start MySQL Server
- Launch XAMPP and click "Start" next to MySQL.

#### Create a Database
1. Open phpMyAdmin (via the "Admin" button in XAMPP).
2. Create a new database named `testdb`.

#### Create the Users Table
- Run the following SQL query in phpMyAdmin to create the `users` table:

```sql
CREATE TABLE users (
    id INT AUTO_INCREMENT PRIMARY KEY,
    username VARCHAR(50) NOT NULL UNIQUE,
    password VARCHAR(255) NOT NULL,
    email VARCHAR(100),
    created_at TIMESTAMP DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP
);
```
#### Insert Sample Data
- Add some sample records for testing by running the following SQL query in phpMyAdmin:

```sql
INSERT INTO users (username, password, email)
VALUES 
('testuser', 'testpassword', 'testuser@example.com'),
('admin', 'adminpassword', 'admin@example.com');
```

### 4. Configure the Java Project

#### Open the Project
- Open the project in **NetBeans IDE**.

#### Add MySQL Connector/J to the Project
1. Right-click on the project in NetBeans.
2. Go to **Properties > Libraries > Add JAR/Folder**.
3. Select the MySQL Connector `.jar` file (e.g., `mysql-connector-java-8.x.x.jar`).

#### Modify the `DatabaseConnection.java` File
- Update the database details in the file with your configuration:

```java
private static final String URL = "jdbc:mysql://localhost:3306/testdb";
private static final String USER = "root";
private static final String PASSWORD = "";
```
### 5. Run the Application

#### Run `Homepage.java` in NetBeans
1. Right-click `Homepage.java` in the project explorer.
2. Select **Run File**.

#### Interact with the Application
- Use the **"View Profile"** button to fetch user details.

---

### 6. Troubleshooting

#### Database Connection Fails
- Ensure MySQL is running in XAMPP.
- Verify the database name, username, and password in `DatabaseConnection.java`.

#### JAR File Missing
- Ensure the MySQL Connector `.jar` file is added to the projectâ€™s classpath.
